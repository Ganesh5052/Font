      <div>
<p><i>Data mining is increasingly being used to gain competitive advantage. In this chapter,<br>
we propose a principle of maximum performance efficiency (MPE) as a contribution to<br>
the data-mining toolkit. This principle seeks to estimate optimal or boundary behavior,<br>
in contrast to techniques like regression analysis that predict average behavior. This<br>
MPE principle is explained in the context of activity-based costing situation.<br>
Specifically, we consider the activity-based costing situation in which multiple<br>
activities generate a common cost pool. Individual cost drivers are assigned to the<br>
respective activities, but allocation of the cost pool to the individual activities is<br>
regarded as impractical or expensive. Our study focuses on published data from a set</i></p>
